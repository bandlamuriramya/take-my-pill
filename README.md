# 💊 Take My Pill

**Take My Pill** is a minimal yet powerful **Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed to remind users to take their medicines on time — using both **browser notifications** and **voice alerts**.

Built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, this app works completely **offline**, is **installable** on phones/desktops, and requires **no sign-in** or data collection. Just set your reminders and stay healthy.

## 📦 How It Works

1. User enters a medicine name and time
2. At that time, the app:
   - Shows a **push notification**
   - **Speaks**: “It’s time to take [medicine name]”
3. Works in the background (thanks to `setInterval`)
4. Reminders are stored locally so they stay even after refresh
